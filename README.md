# TitanicSurvivalPrediction
This project builds a machine learning model to predict passenger survival on the Titanic using the Kaggle Titanic dataset. It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training to identify patterns in survival likelihood. The model is tested against the provided datasets to evaluate performance.

Highlights

- Uses Pandas and NumPy for data handling and preprocessing.

- Handles missing values, categorical encoding, and feature selection.

- Trains multiple ML models for survival prediction and evaluates accuracy.

- Based on the classic Kaggle Titanic Machine Learning Challenge.

Explanation of files:

- train.csv – Training dataset with passenger information and survival outcomes.

- test.csv – Test dataset for generating survival predictions.

- gender_submission.csv – Example Kaggle submission file for format reference.

- predictor.ipynb – Jupyter Notebook containing data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
